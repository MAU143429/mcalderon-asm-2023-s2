# üéß Mixed Signals Projects ‚Äî CE-1110

## üß† Overview

This repository contains a set of three academic projects developed for the course CE1110 - An√°lisis de Se√±ales Mixtas at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica. Each project explores different aspects of analog and digital signal processing, applying both theoretical concepts and practical implementations using microcontrollers and signal processing tools like FFT, modulation, and control systems.

## üì¶ Projects Included

### üîÅ Project 1: Signal Reconstruction with Complex Variables

This project focused on:
- Spectral analysis using complex variable integration
- Phase manipulation of audio signals
- Signal reconstruction from noisy or distorted inputs
- Development of spectrogram generators and FFT visualizations using Python/Octave

The project applied advanced signal theory concepts to real-world audio processing challenges.

### üì° Project 2: Local Radio Transmission System

This project focused on the design of a modulated AM system composed of:
- A transmitter that sends two different signals via two AM carriers
- Two receivers, each tuned to a specific signal
- Real-time audio playback using microphones, speakers, and amplification

The project includes Python/Octave simulations and a microcontroller implementation of FFT-based AM modulation/demodulation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project 3: PID-Based Physical Control System

A physical plant was built to simulate a motorized base, using:
- Two potentiometers (one as user input, the other to measure position)
- A DC motor to move a physical platform
- A PID controller implemented on a microcontroller

The system ensures smooth and accurate positioning based on user-defined setpoints, comparing responses with and without the controller.
